Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow.

	"content": "VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

These components work together to simulate on-premises DNS forwarding and name resolution.\nDeploy the CloudFormation stack The CloudFormation template will create additional services to support an on-premises simulation:\nOne Route 53 Private Hosted Zone that hosts Alias records for the PrivateLink S3 endpoint One Route 53 Inbound Resolver endpoint that enables \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; to resolve inbound DNS resolution requests to the Private Hosted Zone One Route 53 Outbound Resolver endpoint that enables \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; to forward DNS requests for S3 to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; Click the following link to open the AWS CloudFormation console. The required template will be pre-loaded into the menu. Accept all default and click Create stack. It may take a few minutes for stack deployment to complete. You can continue with the next step without waiting for the deployemnt to finish.\nUpdate on-premise private route table This workshop uses a strongSwan VPN running on an EC2 instance to simulate connectivty between an on-premises datacenter and the AWS cloud. Most of the required components are provisioned before your start. To finalize the VPN configuration, you will modify the \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; routing table to direct traffic destined for the cloud to the strongSwan VPN instance.\nOpen the Amazon EC2 console\nSelect the instance named infra-vpngw-test. From the Details tab, copy the Instance ID and paste this into your text editor\nNavigate to the VPC menu by using the Search box at the top of the browser window.\nClick on Route Tables, select the RT Private On-prem route table, select the Routes tab, and click Edit Routes.\nClick Add route.

	"content": "FitAI Challenge An application that helps users lose weight through exercise challenges, integrated with AI for tracking and evaluation 1. Executive Summary FitAI Challenge is a website developed for Vietnamese users, aiming to promote fitness and exercise culture through sports challenges that incorporate gamification and artificial intelligence (AI). The website uses an AI Camera to recognize and count exercise movements such as push-ups, squats, planks, and jumping jacks, while also analyzing posture to provide accurate evaluations. Users can participate in individual challenges to earn FitPoints upon completing tasks, which can be redeemed for vouchers, gifts, or discounts from partner merchants. FitAI Challenge targets students, young adults, and working professionals — individuals who need motivation to maintain regular workout habits amid their busy lives.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? In Vietnam, most existing fitness applications primarily focus on basic guidance or step counting, and there is currently no platform that combines AI-based motion recognition, gamification, and an online fitness challenge community. Users often lack motivation to exercise consistently and do not have tools that can accurately evaluate their workout performance. In addition, gyms and sports brands also lack creative engagement channels to connect with young and active customer groups.\nThe Solution FitAI Challenge uses an AI Camera to recognize, count, and evaluate the accuracy of workout movements through Computer Vision. All user workout data is stored and processed via AWS Cloud using a serverless architecture: AWS Lambda: processes AI data and backend requests. AWS S3: stores videos, images, and temporary results. The website is developed using React Native with a friendly and intuitive interface. Users can: Participate in individual, group, or nationwide challenges. Earn FitPoints upon completing exercises. Redeem FitPoints for vouchers or gifts from partners (Shopee, Grab, CGV, etc.). Track leaderboards and share achievements on social media.\nBenefits and Return on Investment For users: Create daily workout motivation through challenge and reward mechanisms. Receive transparent performance evaluations supported by AI. Connect with the fitness community through leaderboards and sharing feeds. For partner businesses: A branding channel associated with a healthy lifestyle. Access to a young, dynamic, and health-conscious customer base. For the development team: Establish a unique “Fitness + Gamification + E-commerce” business model in Vietnam. Serverless cloud architecture helps reduce operating costs and allows easy scalability. The MVP can be developed within the first 3 months with low infrastructure costs (estimated at 0.80 USD/month on AWS).\n3. Solution Architecture FitAI Challenge is an intelligent sports training platform that applies an AWS Serverless architecture combined with an AI/ML pipeline. The system’s goal is to record workout data, analyze performance, and generate AI-powered feedback to provide personalized coaching for users. Data from the web application is sent to Amazon API Gateway, processed by AWS Lambda (Java), and stored in Amazon S3 along with the Docker Database.\nAWS Services Used Service Role Amazon Route 53 Manages domain names and routes traffic to CloudFront. AWS WAF Protects frontend and API layers from DDoS and OWASP attacks. Amazon CloudFront Delivers static content (web app built from Java web, HTML, CSS, JS). Amazon API Gateway Receives requests from the frontend and forwards them to Lambda functions. AWS Lambda (Java) Handles business logic (registration, login, data upload, scoring, AI pipeline). AWS Step Functions \u0026amp; SQS Coordinates workflows between Lambda and SageMaker/Bedrock. Amazon Cognito Authenticates users, manages login sessions, and controls access permissions. Amazon S3 Stores raw data, videos, images, and analysis results. Docker Runs the Java Spring Boot API backend and hosts the database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB). Amazon SageMaker Runs inference for computer vision/pose estimation models. Amazon Bedrock Generates natural language feedback, training suggestions, and summary reports. Amazon SES Sends authentication emails and user result notifications. Amazon CloudWatch Monitors logs, Lambda performance, costs, and system efficiency. IAM Manages access permissions and security across services. AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild / CodeDeploy CI/CD pipeline for automating Java backend and Lambda deployment. Component Design Frontend Layer: The web app displays the user interface and connects to the API Gateway. The content is built and deployed on S3 + CloudFront. Users access the system through Route 53 → WAF → CloudFront → API Gateway. Application Layer: The API Gateway receives requests from the frontend. Lambda (Java) executes business functions: AuthLambda: handles user login and authentication. UploadLambda: receives workout data, images, or videos. AIPipelineLambda: triggers the AI workflow (SageMaker + Bedrock). SaveResultLambda: stores training results and AI feedback.\n4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nPhase Description Achieved Outcome 1. AWS Infrastructure Setup Deploy Route 53, WAF, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, Docker DB. Basic infrastructure ready. 2. CI/CD Pipeline Set up CodeCommit + CodeBuild + CodeDeploy for Java backend and Lambda. Automated backend deployment. 3. Build Lambda Functions (Java) Create Lambdas for Upload, Auth, AI Pipeline, and Save Result. Completed serverless backend. 4. AI Pipeline Integrate SageMaker (pose estimation model) and Bedrock (LLM feedback). AI runs smoothly with automated feedback. 5. Web App Deployment Build web → Deploy to S3 + CloudFront. User interface runs online. 6. Monitoring \u0026amp; Cost Optimization Use CloudWatch + Cost Explorer for activity tracking. Stable system with low cost. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Before internship (Month 0): Design detailed architecture and experiment with basic AI models. Internship (Month 1–3): Month 1: Set up infrastructure, configure Docker DB, Cognito, API Gateway, and Lambda. Month 2: Develop and complete the Java backend, build the AI pipeline with SageMaker \u0026amp; Bedrock. Month 3: Testing \u0026amp; Demo — perform performance testing, run pilot with 10–20 users, and prepare the final demo. Post-deployment: Continue research and development for one year. 6. Budget Estimation You can find the budget estimation on the AWS Pricing Calculator.\nOr you can download the Budget Estimation File.\nInfrastructure Costs AWS Services: Amazon API Gateway: 0.38 USD / month (300 requests/month, 1 KB/request) Amazon Bedrock: 0.32 USD / month (1 req/min, 350 input tokens, 70 output tokens) Amazon CloudFront: 1.20 USD / month (5 GB transfer, 500,000 HTTPS requests) Amazon CloudWatch: 1.85 USD / month (5 metrics, 0.5 GB logs) Amazon Cognito: 0.00 USD / month (100 MAU, Advanced Security enabled) Amazon Route 53: 0.51 USD / month (1 hosted zone) Amazon SageMaker: 0.02 USD / month (1 request/month, 0.2 GB in/out, 500 ms/request) Amazon S3: 0.04 USD / month (1 GB storage, 1,000 PUT/POST/LIST, 20,000 GET) Amazon SES: 0.30 USD / month (3,000 emails from EC2) Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS): 0.00 USD / month (0.005 million requests/month) AWS Lambda: 0.00 USD / month (300,000 requests/month, 512 MB ephemeral storage) AWS Step Functions: 0.00 USD / month (500 workflows, 5 state transitions/workflow) AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF): 6.12 USD / month (1 Web ACL, 1 rule) Total: 10.74 USD / month; 128.88 USD / 12 months\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Technical: AI misidentifies incorrect movements or encounters errors in processing image/video data. User: Users fail to maintain workout habits, leading to low retention. Market \u0026amp; Partners: Difficulty in expanding the partner network for rewards and brand collaborations. Mitigation Strategies Continuously optimize the AI model through regular and ongoing training. Additionally, user consent can be obtained to use their workout videos to improve model performance. Implement deeper gamification features (streak chains, friend groups, attractive rewards). Research partners thoroughly and clearly present collaboration value to establish long-term partnerships. Contingency Plans When the AI encounters errors → add a fallback system to switch between different model versions.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;.

Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink.

	"content": "AWS PrivateLink endpoints have a fixed IP address in each Availability Zone where they are deployed, for the life of the endpoint (until it is deleted). These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section).

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud.

AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them.

	"content": " Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nOverall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future? Any other comments (free sharing): "
